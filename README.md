 ## Assignment Brief
In this project, students will build an application that provides civic data intended to provide educational opportunities to the U.S. electorate using data provided by the Google Civic Information API.  
Students will use data from this API to allow users to track information on target representatives and voting initiatives where applicable.  

Users will be able to target a specific location and retrieve the associated civic data, displaying it to the user, and providing a clean user experience for consumption.  
Users will be able to save predefined locations for quick access and mark preferred representatives and policy outcomes. Where available, elections and voter information will also be provided, notifying the users on upcoming elections and providing access to associated information and saved data.

âœ¦ **API -** Integrate API so that the application can pull civic data for a provided address and store locally.   
âœ¦ **Preferred Candidates -** Allow users to mark preferred candidates.  
âœ¦ **Register API -** Register the API in the Google Developer Console and ensure the application can connect.  
âœ¦ **Expand API Functionality -** Expand API functionality to include ballot data for provided locations and corresponding user selections.    
âœ¦ **Authentication and Data Storage -** Enable user-level authentication and data storage. Expand location selection to use geo-location to generate address information.   
âœ¦ **UI -** Refine and enhance UI.
